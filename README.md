## Executive summary

Using a random forest classifier with a k-fold cross-validation of 5, the optimal model has an OOB estimate of the error rate of 0.7%. The variable importance plot shows that the \`roll_belt\` variable is the most important variable in predicting the \`classe\` variable. When the model is applied to the training set, an accuracy of 100% is obtained, which is reduced to 99.5% when applied to the validation set.
